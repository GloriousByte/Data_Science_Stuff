#### Revising_Python_With_Jupyter
The folder contains work done while revising foundational python. The practise
sessions were done in a jupyter notebook. Numpy and pandas were covered at an 
introductory level. 
NB: the jupyter files uploaded are missing sessions on fundamental numpy and pandas.
The files weren't saved/backed up.
