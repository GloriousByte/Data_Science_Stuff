### !Repository To Keep Track Of Progress With Data Science/Engineering

#### Revising_Python_With_Jupyter
The folder contains work done while revising foundational python. The practise
sessions were done in a jupyter notebook. Numpy and pandas were covered at an 
introductory level.</br>
NB: the jupyter files uploaded are missing sessions on fundamental numpy and pandas.
The files weren't saved/backed up.

#### python_with_Corey
contains python files with code on file handling and regular expressions.
</br>
NB: more types of regular expression were covered but either deleted from the
file after practising/ not bothered with at all because the concepts were pretty
straight forward easy to grasp.
